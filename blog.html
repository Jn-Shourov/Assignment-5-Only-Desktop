        What are the different ways to select an
        element in the
        DOM?</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600 text-xl">There are 5 different ways to select an element in the DOM:
        <br><br>
        1.
        document.getElementsByTagName : Select one or more elements of HTML by its/their tag or element name.
        <br>
        2.
        document.getElementById : Select one HTML element by its unique id.
        <br>
        3. document.getElementsByClass : Select one or
        more elements of HTML by its/their class name.
        <br>
        4.
        document.querySelector : Select one element of HTML by its CSS selector.
        <br>
        5. document.querySelectorAll : Select one
        or more elements of HTML by its/their CSS selector.
      </p>

      <p class="text-[var(--primary-text)] text-xl font-bold pb-4 border-b-2 border-dashed border-slate-200">Question-2:
        What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600 text-xl">The differences between them are :
        <br><br>
        1. innerHTML : IT gives us each and every character written in that perticular element or tag, even other HTML
        contents, just not the comments.
        <br>
        2. innerText : IT gives us only the text or string that is shown on the webpage, written in that element
        ignoring
        other things.
        <br>
        3. textContent : IT gives us only the text that is written in that element ignoring other things like
        'innerText'
        but whether its shown or hidden in webpage by CSS properties, it will give us every text in between that
        element. So, CSS does not applied to it.

      <p class="text-[var(--primary-text)] text-xl font-bold pb-4 border-b-2 border-dashed border-slate-200">Question-3:
        What is event delegation in the DOM?</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600 text-xl">Event Delegation in the DOM is a very unique but useful technique to work
        with dynamically created child item in any parent node. It is used for handling events by the parent instead of
        child elements using the help of Event Bubbling concept.

        <br><br>
        Also it solves the problem of using too much event listener in the child nodes. So the problem is, when a child
        node is created by DOM, the event listeners added for the previously built in child nodes do not work for the
        new one. Then a solution can be done by putting new event listener for each newly created child node which is
        not very sufficient way to handle this. So the best approach to this problem is to add the event listener to the
        parent node and then any of the child node don't need an event listener for each self but the event listener of
        the parent works for all, no matter its created by DOM or previously built in by HTML. And, this approach to
        this problem is known as Event Delegation.

      <p class="text-[var(--primary-text)] text-xl font-bold pb-4 border-b-2 border-dashed border-slate-200">Question-4:
        What is event bubbling in the DOM?</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600 text-xl">Event Bubbling is a propagation mechanism which allows a target element
        during the event to propagate to its ancestor starting with its parent element. That means when an event occurs,
        the target element bubbles up the order and search for more events through its ancestor upto the body node
        unless its stopped.
        <br><br>
        For example, let's assume there is a button inside a div both having one event listener for
        each to show
        something in
        the console on clicking on each of them. The scenarios:
        <br>
        1. Now, if there occurs a click on the div other than where the button is, the console will show what the event
        requires to show for clicking on the div. It has nothing to do with the button's event.
        <br>
        2. But, if there occurs a click on the button, the console will show the button
        event output and will bubble up the order searching for another event and will find its parent element (the div)
        having another item
        to show on console and will show that also.
        <br><br>
        That means, the console will not stop just after showing the result for clicking
        the child node. It also will search for events of parent node and show the result for the event if there is one.
        That is what Event Bubble is in the DOM.

        How do you create, add, and remove elements using JavaScript?</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600 text-xl">
        Using a button and showing how to create, add and remove an element, using JavaScript:
        <br><br>
        1. Create : const newBtn = document.createElement('button');
        <br>
        2. Add : document.body.appendChild(newBtn);
        <br>
        3. Remove : document.body.removeChild(newBtn);
        <br>
        or, newBtn.remove();
        <br><br>
        This is how to create (.createElement('Element Tag')), add (.appendChild(element)) and remove
        (.removeChild(element) / element.remove()) an
        element using
        JavaScript.
